I have two datasets.firstly i imported both the datasets.One dataset is rossman store which contains 1017209 rows and 9 columns.The dataset doesn't contain any null or duplicated values.It gives us inforamation about the type of store,sales in each store by what date through how many number of customers.Also whether the sale was affected by closure of shop on weekends or or any kind of stateholiday or schoolholiday.It also gives on how sales was affected on applying promo.The other dataset is store which has 1115 Rows and 10 Column.This dataset contains too many null values in different columns.It provides information like type of store and what is assostment level used in store,how far away is competitor from store,since how long is competitor there in the market and how often is promo applied on the store.\n",

        "I droped some colunms from store datset which contains too many null values and filled some fearture which contains very less amount of null values and then i merged both the datasets.I then checked for outliers and there were some columns which contained outliers and then treated them using percentile method.\n",

        "Then i performed EDA (univeriate,Biveriate and Multiveriate analysis) to extract some useful insights from the data.Then i performed Feature Enginering and data preprocessing in which i performed label encoding for categirical features and defined some new features also ,i calculated VIF to find out Multicolinearity between the features and selected important feature for futher analysis.Then i splitted the data in dependent and independent variables and transformed the data using Standard Scaler.Then i split the data in x_train,y_train,x_test,y_test with test size as 0.2.\n",

The XGBoost model outperformed the other models in several key aspects, making it the preferred choice for prediction"
